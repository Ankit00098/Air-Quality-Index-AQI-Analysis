# Air-Quality-Index-AQI-Analysis
# Monitoring Pollution Levels Across Indian Cities 🌍

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** across major Indian cities to uncover pollution patterns, dominant pollutants, and temporal trends.  
The interactive Power BI dashboard provides clear insights into air quality variations, helping to understand regions and periods with high pollution levels.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze AQI levels at city and state levels
- Identify dominant pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, etc.)
- Visualize AQI trends over time
- Compare pollution patterns across different regions
- Support environmental awareness through data-driven insights

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights
- Overall AQI Score and Category
- State-wise AQI Map
- City-wise AQI Comparison
- AQI Trend Analysis (Time Series)
- Pollutant Frequency Distribution

### 🔎 Interactive Filters
- Year  
- State  
- City  
- Month  

## 🧪 Key Insights
- Certain cities consistently show high AQI levels
- PM10 and PM2.5 are the most frequent dominant pollutants
- Winter months record higher average AQI values
- Significant spatial variation in air quality across India

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** — Dashboard creation and data visualization
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** — Data cleaning and preprocessing
- **Dataset** — AQI records sourced for Indian cities

## 📂 Project Files
- `.pbix` file — Interactive Power BI dashboard

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Download the Power BI `.pbix` file from this repository
2. Open it using **Power BI Desktop**
3. Use filters and visuals to explore AQI insights

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Integration of real-time AQI data using APIs
- Predictive AQI modeling using Machine Learning
- Health impact analysis based on AQI levels
- Deployment as a web-based interactive dashboard
